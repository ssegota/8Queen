#8 Queens Evolutionary

This is a Python program that solves a 8 Queen puzzle.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle):

> The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

##Short solution description

In the beginning code generates a 1000 random movesets(Positions of Queens). 

Then in each new generation movesets from the past are recombined at random, with a chance of random mutation. The code is using an exponential probability function to make it more likely to pick a value with better fitness from the sorted array.

When the solution is found, i.e. fitness function equals 8, the program stops and prints the solution.

##Results

Examples of solutions were generated using the software in this repository.

Positions of Queens are denoted by (X,Y) where X would present the horizontal or "letter" coordinate on the baord and Y the vertical or "number" coordinate on the board looking from the top. They are both in range of `[0,7]`. So a coordinate `[1,4]` in the below solution would be equal to chess board position of **E7**.

###Solution Example 1
Positions of Queens: [[2, 5], [7, 4], [1, 1], [6, 7], [3, 2], [0, 6], [4, 0], [5, 3]]
